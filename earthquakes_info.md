### Inspiration

 Ashswor Shresta's shiny app of the [earthquakes in Nepal](https://asheshwor.shinyapps.io/np-quake)

  ---

### Method

The data is provided by the [US geological survey] (http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/all_month.csv) which collates data for the past 30 days every 15 minutes.

If left open, the app repolls every hour

The range of magnitudes can be selected. From inspection, it appears as though a disproportinate share of
small earthquakes are reported in North America
